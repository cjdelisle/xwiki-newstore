New interfaces for providing attachment storage and adapters between the new interfaces and
the old interfaces which they replace.

These APIs are temporary until XWikiAttachment is replaced with a new object interface, then
they will be deprecated and new but similar ones will be developed to support the new attachment
type.

Yet another adapter will be developed to adapt the new attachment type to XWikiAttachment and the
attachment store interfaces will no longer have to depend on the old core.

These interfaces, and the adapters which go with them, are designed to make developing new
attachment stores easy, to develop a new attachment store you can implement the interfaces in
src/main/java/org/xwiki/store/attachments/newstore/internal/ then extend the abstract classes in
src/main/java/org/xwiki/store/attachments/adapter/internal/ providing the functions to get your
store classes and a StartableTransactionRunnable which provides the appropriate context for them.
All of the idiosyncrasies of the original attachment storage API will be handled in the adapters.

Keep in mind that while this is new code and is much preferred to implementing the old core
interfaces directly, it is not the final implementation, after a new attachment interface is
developed it will supersede these interfaces.
